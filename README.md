# SudokuSolverX

## Overview
Welcome to **SudokuSolverX**, the ultimate companion for puzzling enthusiasts! Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned solver, this app is designed to help you solve Sudoku puzzles effortlessly. With an intuitive interface, a timer feature, and customizable difficulty levels, it ensures that solving Sudoku is as fun as it is satisfying. The app uses efficient backtracking algorithms to solve puzzles, offering real-time feedback and a smooth user experience.

## Key Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**:  
At the heart of the app’s solving functionality is the backtracking algorithm. This step-by-step process offers users insight into how the solution is built, making the puzzle-solving journey engaging and educational. The algorithm places numbers in empty cells, backtracks when an invalid configuration is encountered, and ensures that the final solution adheres to Sudoku’s rules.

- **Puzzle Generation**:  
The puzzle generator employs constraint satisfaction techniques and randomization to create valid Sudoku puzzles with a unique solution. It uses **depth-first search (DFS)** to generate valid configurations while maintaining the constraints of Sudoku (no repeating numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids). The difficulty level is controlled by adjusting the number of initially filled cells.

- **Interactive Interface**:  
The grid is fully interactive, allowing users to enter numbers and navigate through the puzzle easily. Cells change color to indicate invalid entries, helping users avoid common mistakes. Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty settings, with each generating a puzzle tailored to your level. You can clear the grid or let the app solve the puzzle for you with a single click. Additionally, hints are provided to guide you as you solve the puzzle.

## Conclusion
**SudokuSolverX** is more than just a fun puzzle app—it’s a showcase of powerful **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** techniques in action! With backtracking, it turns a classic game into a practical example of algorithmic problem-solving. Whether you're new to DSA or refining your skills, this project highlights how algorithms can solve real-world challenges with elegance and efficiency. Get ready to dive deep into the world of algorithms while having fun solving puzzles!
